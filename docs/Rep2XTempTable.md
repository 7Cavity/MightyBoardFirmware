# Temperature Table for recording Temperatures for the Rep2X's Thermistor

## Table:
All temperature were taken with a Fluke Type k Thermocouple.  Temperatures were set with RepG, and given ~2 minutes to settle.  In the event of a constant oscillating temperature, the average was recorded.  Temperatures above 70°C tended to oscillate more than temperatures below.
